            <p> &nbsp &nbsp In your app, you can add as many languages as you want. By languages, I mean the language of
                the text
                that we see in any mobile application. For example, if you have English, French, and Hindi users, then
                you can have language support for all these languages. Like "Hello" in English will become "Bonjour" in
                French and "नमस्ते" in Hindi.
            </p>
            <p> &nbsp &nbsp
                But how can we change the language? That's the topic for this blog. In this blog, we will learn how to
                change the App locale in Android with ease.
                <br />
                By default, you have English as your default language for the whole app and the text corresponding to
                the English language will be there in our strings.xml file. So, similarly, for other languages, you need
                to add their strings.xml file.
                <br />
                So, basically Android loads the resources related to language based on the system locale setting. For
                example, if the language of your Android phone is English, then strings.xml of English will be loaded by
                Android. We do not have to do anything extra here.
                <br />
                But, many times, we want our users to change the language of our App only by selecting the preferred
                language and not by changing the language of our Android phone. So, let's see how to add this.
                First of all, create a project in Android Studio. Here, we will be having 2 activities:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    MainActivity -
                </li>
                <p>
                    This will contain one welcome TextView and two Buttons, one for opening the next activity in the
                    English language and the other for opening the next activity in the Hindi language.
                </p>
                <li>
                    LanguageActivity -
                </li>
                <p>
                    This will simply contain a TextView displaying some message. The message will be shown in English if
                    the language of the app is English and the message will be shown in Hindi if the language of the app
                    is Hindi.
                </p>
            </ul>
